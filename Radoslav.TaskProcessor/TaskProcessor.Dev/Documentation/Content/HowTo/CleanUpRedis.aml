      <para>This document describes how to clean up Redis, i.e. how to delete all data from Redis.</para>

      <para>
        This is usefull when debugging because every time you start a task processor instance,
        it registes itself in Redis and if there are no other task processor instances, it registers itself as a master
        task processor. This record expires after some time, but until then if you start another task processor instance,
        it registers itself as a slave (because there is already a record for the master in Redis). This is not convenient when
        starting and stopping task processor a lot during development, so sometimes it is useful to clear your Redis and free the
        master record so when you start the task processor for debugging, it will be a master, not a slave.
